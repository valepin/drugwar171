IDEAS:
placebo study.. i.e. look at the match for Juarez

simulation study - use cross-validation to choose weights. Look at different loss functions? What about maximizing the overlapping coefficient OVL

\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} min\{ f_1(X), f_2(X) } dX

But now it's multivariate? What about an empirical measure?

Also synthetic is piece by piece. I.e. do minimization with just one treatment unit. what about overall minimization?

- background
- problem description (potential outcome framework)
- analysis
- valeria extensions
- monthly homicide rate - organized crime. 


- compare original analysis with synthetic matching (drug war)
- simulation study. Keep covariates constant (from drugwar study). Sim response and look at different models. One being where there is an interaction between the covariates and the treatment vector. 
- synthetic matching
- when true model is linear combo of covariates synthetic will be ok. 
- covariate adjustment
- compa

- visualization ( up for grabs ). whoever needs more time. 
- talk about how visualization helps the design. Loveplot. 
- highlight region and matches. Spelling mistake. Loveplot make legend smaller. 
- exploratory tool or way of displaying results. But this is helping the design/modeling. Sit with expert would help. Expert could select matches..? 
- can't be a cheater.
